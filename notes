What things correlate with incorrectness on a problem?

  * Problem number ("Subjective Advancedness", "Fatigue"?)

  * Time spent on puzzles

  * Time since doing previous batch

  
  Program output metrics (Raphael paper object tree)
    (Correct answer, 3 wrong answers, 3 hint answers)

  * Big bounding box size

  * Correct answer's index within answers sorted by big bounding box size

  * Variation in child bounding box sizes


  Program structure metrics
  * Circles vs squares vs other ...

  * Number of prompts

  * Number of nodes in graph
    (Count spaces after removing parens) 

  * Max tree Depth
    (Count max run of close parens)

  * Tree Breadth
    (Number of leaf nodes.  Count spaces after removing parens and function tokens)

  * Number of "concepts"/"constructs" used
  * Number of new "concepts"/"constructs" used
      * Number or previous problems with same construct/concept

  * Call graph:
    * Max depth
    * Branchyness
    * Has a cycle


  * For all program structure metrics:
     * Variation between prompts


  * For all program structure metrics
     * Difference from previous problem


   //Pass in output of math expression

   //Math in functiion
      //Math in SOME functions, not others
   

   //Shape in function differs between hints


   //Function with a nested expression inside

   //Calling a function twice (e.g. (beside mystery mystery))

   //Function that returns a number

   //Function with two+ params

   //Two different functions mystery1 mystery2

   //Function that calls another function
      // And so on
