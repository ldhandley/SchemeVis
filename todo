* We need to deal with people who retake puzzles
  * Some people who get rejected on first puzzle might retake
  * We've had some people retake when we forget to give them qualification

* We should segment out people who have gone in order vs. people who haven't
  * Add worker previous history into output data structure
    * For Level-3 output
      * Did Worker do Level-1? When?
      * Did Worker do Level-2? When?
  * Make graph widget for choosing population of workers
    * Workers who did Level-1,2,3 in order
    * Workers who did Levels out of order
